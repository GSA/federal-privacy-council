The USA PATRIOT Act modified many major U.S. intelligence, communications, and privacy laws, including: The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (EPCA ), which modifies Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act (the Wiretap Act ); the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA); and the Communications Act of 1934.  The USA PATRIOT Act has been reauthorized and amended several times since its initial enactment.

The USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-177 
The reauthorizing legislation made permanent 14 of the 16 sunsetted USA PATRIOT Act provisions and placed four-year sunsets on the other two—the authority to conduct “roving” surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and the authority to request production of business records under FISA (USA PATRIOT Act sections 206 and 215, respectively).
</UL>

<BR>
Among the 14 USA PATRIOT Act provisions made permanent are: 

<UL>

<LI>Facilitating enhanced information-sharing and coordination 
between national security and law enforcement personnel.</LI>

<LI>Adding certain chemical weapons offenses, international 
terrorism, nuclear and weapons of mass destruction threats,
and computer espionage offenses to the list of wiretap predicates.</LI>

<LI>Allowing Internet Service Providers to disclose 
customer records voluntarily to the government in 
emergencies involving an immediate risk of death or serious physical injury.</LI>

<LI>Permitting victims of computer trespass (hacking) crimes to request law enforcement assistance 
in monitoring trespassers on their computers.</LI>

The USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorization Amendments Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-178, was written to clarify that individuals who receive FISA orders can challenge nondisclosure requirements; that individuals who receive national security letters are not required to disclose the name of their attorney; and that libraries are not wire or electronic communication service providers unless they provide specific services.

On June 2, 2015, Congress passed and the President signed the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015,  Pub. L. No. 114-23. The Act reauthorized several important national security authorities; banned bulk collection under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, under the pen register and trap and trace provisions found in Title IV of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), or pursuant to National Security Letters; adopted the new legal mechanism proposed by the President regarding the targeted production of telephony metadata; made significant modifications to proceedings before the FISC; and built on the U.S. Government’s unprecedented transparency about intelligence activities.
