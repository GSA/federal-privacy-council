<p>Every year 20 to 30 percent of college-accepted high school graduates in urban districts fail to matriculate in college in the fall—a phenomenon known as “summer melt.”</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-insight">What is the insight?</h2>

<p>Sending students text message reminders about key tasks related to college matriculation, such as completing financial aid paperwork, have been found to increase first-year enrollment. By delivering these messages at times when students can take action, each reminder prompts direct action that supports college enrollment.</p>

<p>Personalized text messages were designed for students and parents, reminding them of critical tasks. The text messages also provided recipients with a connection to individualized college and financial aid advising.</p>

<h2 id="what-was-the-impact">What was the impact?</h2>

<p>Among all students sent text messages, 68.0 percent enrolled in college in the fall compared with 64.9 percent of those not sent messages. Enrollment effects were larger for the lowest-income students and for first-generation students. Among low-income students, the text messages increased enrollment from 66.4 percent to 72.1 percent.</p>
